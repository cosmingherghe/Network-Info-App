# Network Information Application
This Spring Boot application provides detailed information about network interfaces and can be deployed on various containers. It's built as part of my learning process on networking concepts like IP addresses, MAC addresses, loopback interfaces, multicast support, and more.

## Features
- Retrieves detailed information on network cards such as:
    - MAC address
    - IP (IPv4/IPv6) addresses
    - Loopback and point-to-point status
    - Multicast support
    - Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
    - Virtual/Physical interface detection
- Supports deployment on different containers using Docker.

## Technologies
- Spring Boot - for building the web application.
- Java - for writing the core logic.
- Docker - for containerizing the application.
